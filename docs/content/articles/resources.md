# Useful resources

## [GitHub](https://github.com/)

was started by Linus Torvalds — the same person who created Linux. 
GitHub.com — allows developers to store their git projects and 
network with like-minded people.

## [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

a lot of manuals and documentation for every application.
